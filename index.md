We're getting married!

Actually, we already got married in San Francisco in April 2019...
But we are having the wedding party on **June 20th, 2020**.

This is the webpage where we will post any and all information related to the event: details on the venue, tips on travel and getting accommodations, shark advisories, etc.

We will be adding this information as we get it, but if you have a question you'd like answered, please email us at gmail.com@yau.and.smith (but switch the parts before and after the @).
