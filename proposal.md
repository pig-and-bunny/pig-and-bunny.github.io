Jordan is a devoted solver of the [Harper's Magazine](https://harpers.org/) [cryptic crossword](https://harpers.org/puzzles/). While on vacation in France with Robert and his family in August 2018, he solved the puzzle for that month's issue. That month, the puzzle's theme was only hinted at:

> Five unclued entries are related to a common location, which is spelled out by the letters in 25, 3, 44, 15, and 5.
> A sixth entry, the four-word sentence at 34A, might lead there as well. [...]
> Private message for â–ˆâ–ˆ : 1, 14, 6, 16, 10, 17â€”plus 34Aâ€”plus 51, 48, 52, 49, 53, 50.
> A full explanation will appear with the solution in next monthâ€™s issue.

Jordan reflects:

> It didn't take me long to realize that in this puzzle, someone was proposing very publically to someone else.
> But it took me much longer to wrap my head around the possibility that Robert might be proposing to me in it!

The common location is the ALTAR, which is related to the five unclued antries: BAPTISM, BAR/BAT MITZVAH, COMMUNION, CONFIRMATION, and WEDDING.
The four words at 34A, which might also lead there, are of course: "WILL YOU MARRY ME?"

But who was proposing to whom? ðŸ¤”  No need to rush, but your boyfriend and his family are all hanging around waiting... ðŸ™„  Jordan's thought process continues:

> With 34A solved, the message was: \_\_\_\_\_\_, will you marry me, \_\_\_\_\_\_?
> Both names were 6 letters long, so 'Jordan' and 'Robert' would fit!
> I eventually confirmed that all the letters in 'Jordan' were correctâ€”but I couldn't confirm *any* of the letters in 'Robert'.
> So, since 'Jordan' isn't a rare name, I felt throughout that it was reasonable to suspect that the proposal in this national magazine (circulation over 100,000) wasn't directed to me alone.
>
> But of course, it was. Eventually, I realized what was going on: Robert was included in the grid under his nickname, Yauser!

Robert sat beside Jordan throughout the solve. Once Jordan had the letters of both names in place, Robert prodded him to read out the secret message, and the question was formally asked. The answer, of course, was yes!

"Took bloody long enough!"â€”but well worth the wait!
