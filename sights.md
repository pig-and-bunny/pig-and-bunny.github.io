We know it's a long way to come, so why not stay a while? We are planning to arrive a week early and leave a week after the wedding.

When you visit, there is plenty to keep you busy in the area:

- Rent a bike and head to the beach! There's [Herring Cove](https://goo.gl/maps/iK44VL6JpdAumt9DA), the gayer one, and [Race Point](https://goo.gl/maps/fHBR3fnX64PUeJPg9), the farther one. The sunsets and high dunes make for spectacular walks.
- Stroll along Commercial Avenue. Every few feet you'll find another art gallery (P-Town is famous for its artists) and an ice cream parlour.
- P-Town has nightlife: take in a drag show! Jordan saw drag here for the first time in the person of [Varla Jean Merman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varla_Jean_Merman), who sang an aria while eating a spray can of Cheez Whiz.
- The [Provincetown Film Festival](https://www.provincetownfilm.org/festival/) will run June 17--21 in 2020. We went in 2019 and saw some very sweet films, including *An Almost Ordinary Summer*.
- Wine and spirits are made right on the Cape at [Truro Vineyards](https://trurovineyardsofcapecod.com), a pleasant estate where you can enjoy tastings hourly.

Everything listed above is something we've done personally, but many also happen to appear in one of these two *New York Times* guides to the area:

- [36 Hours in Provincetown](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/travel/36-hours-in-provincetown-mass.html)
- [36 Hours on the Outer Cape](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-outer-cape-cod.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)


It's a beautiful place!
