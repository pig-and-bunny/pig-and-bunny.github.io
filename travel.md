### From Provincetown to the venue

The [venue]({{ site.baseurl }}/venue) does **not** have parking, and the nearest parking isn't near. So, for now, plan to arrive via taxi. (We are looking into shuttles, but no firm news on that front yet!)

[TODO: scope out cab companies and add links here.]

### From Boston to Provincetown

- Ferry
	- [Bay State Cruises](https://baystatecruisecompany.com/).
	  <br />Leaves from the pier at the World Trade Center.
	  <br />From airport, take the Silver Line to Congress @ World Trade Center Station.
	  <br />NB: boarding the Silver Line at the airport is free!
	- [Boston Harbor Cruises](https://www.bostonharborcruises.com/provincetown-ferry/).
	  <br />Leaves from the pier next to New England Aquarium.
	  <br />From airport, take airport shuttle to Airport Station on the Blue Line, then take the Blue Line to Aquarium.

Both of these operators have 2--3 ferries per day at a cost of around $61 one-way or $93 round trip.

- Car
	- Driving from Boston to P-Town takes around 2h30m, but there is significant weekend traffic from Boston to the Cape. I.e., departing Boston midday or later on Friday, the trip might take 3h30m or more.
	- NB: the #6 highway that serves Cape Cod has lots of speed limit changes, and speeding is ticketed aggressively in parts of the Cape.

#### Visas

If you're American or Canadian, travelling to Boston should be a breeze.

If you're not, you may need an ESTA waiver. [ESTA Visa Online](https://estaapplicationform.com/) has more information, but it's up to you to research the requirements!
